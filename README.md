# Sorting Tool
JetBrains Academy. Project: Sorting Tool.

In this project, written program processes textual and numeric data</br>
and sorts it. Program will be able to determine the biggest</br>
or most frequent pieces of data and perform the necessary</br>
calculations on them.

Fourth stage. Updated the parsing of command-line arguments to</br>
support the sorting type definition:

>1.if the -sortingType argument is provided,</br>
>it should be followed by natural or byCount,</br>
>which defines the sorting type.</br></br>
>2.if the argument is not provided, then consider</br>
>natural to be the default sorting type.
> 
Implement natural sorting for words and lines, and sorting by count</br>
for all data types. Within the group, elements with equal count</br>
values should be sorted naturally.
